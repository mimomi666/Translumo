# How to Create a Release for Translumo

This guide explains how to create a proper release for the Translumo project now that the GitHub Actions build errors have been resolved.

## Prerequisites

✅ All GitHub Actions errors have been resolved
✅ Package dependencies are aligned (System.Drawing.Common 8.0.0)
✅ Code is merged to `master` branch
✅ Workflows are configured and ready

## Release Methods

### Method 1: Using Git Tags (Recommended)

This is the preferred method as it creates a permanent version reference in git history.

```bash
# 1. Ensure you're on master and up-to-date
git checkout master
git pull origin master

# 2. Create and push a version tag
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

The release workflow will automatically trigger and:
- Build the Windows executable
- Create a ZIP package
- Generate GitHub Release with detailed notes
- Upload artifacts

### Method 2: Manual Workflow Dispatch

You can also trigger the release manually from GitHub UI:

1. Navigate to [Actions → Build and Release](https://github.com/mimomi666/Translumo/actions/workflows/release.yml)
2. Click the "Run workflow" button
3. Select branch: `master`
4. Enter version (e.g., `1.0.0`)
5. Click "Run workflow"

## Version Numbering

Follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer):
- **Major.Minor.Patch** format (e.g., `1.0.0`)
- Major: Breaking changes
- Minor: New features (backwards compatible)
- Patch: Bug fixes

Suggested version for first release: **v1.0.0**

## What Gets Released

The release package includes:

### Main Files
- `Translumo.exe` - Self-contained Windows executable
- `README.md` - Project documentation
- `LICENSE` - Apache 2.0 license
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Technical details

### Additional Directories (if present)
- `models/` - AI/ML models
- `python/` - Python dependencies

### Release Notes

The workflow automatically generates comprehensive release notes including:
- Feature highlights (multimodal translation support)
- Quick start guides for traditional and AI-powered translation
- System requirements
- Documentation links
- Installation instructions

## Monitoring the Release

After triggering the release:

1. **Monitor workflow progress**:
   - Go to [Actions](https://github.com/mimomi666/Translumo/actions)
   - Click on the running workflow
   - Monitor each step

2. **Expected duration**: ~5-10 minutes
   - Checkout: ~10s
   - .NET Setup: ~15s
   - Restore: ~60s
   - Build/Publish: ~120-300s
   - Package creation: ~10s
   - Release creation: ~15s

3. **Verify release**:
   - Check [Releases page](https://github.com/mimomi666/Translumo/releases)
   - Download and test the ZIP package
   - Verify Translumo.exe runs correctly

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow Requires Approval

If you see "action_required" status:
- This happens for first-time workflows from bot accounts
- Repository owner needs to approve the workflow run
- Go to the workflow run and click "Approve and run"

### Build Failures

If the build fails:
1. Check the workflow logs for specific errors
2. Common issues:
   - Missing dependencies: Check `.csproj` files
   - Compilation errors: Review code changes
   - Package conflicts: Verify package versions match

### Release Already Exists

If creating a release with an existing tag:
- Delete the old tag: `git tag -d v1.0.0 && git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.0`
- Or use a new version number

## Post-Release Tasks

After successful release:

1. **Announce the release**:
   - Update repository README if needed
   - Notify users/contributors
   - Share on relevant platforms

2. **Verify functionality**:
   - Download the release package
   - Test on a clean Windows system
   - Verify both traditional and multimodal translation work

3. **Document known issues** (if any):
   - Create issues for any problems found
   - Update release notes if critical issues discovered

## Example: Creating v1.0.0

```bash
# Complete example workflow
cd /path/to/Translumo
git checkout master
git pull origin master

# Verify everything is up-to-date
git status

# Create the release tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0 with multimodal translation support"
git push origin v1.0.0

# Monitor at: https://github.com/mimomi666/Translumo/actions
```
