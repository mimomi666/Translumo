# Quick Reference: Create v1.0.0 Release

## TL;DR

The errors are fixed. The code is ready. Create the release now:

```bash
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

Or use GitHub UI: [Actions → Build and Release](https://github.com/mimomi666/Translumo/actions/workflows/release.yml) → Run workflow → Enter `1.0.0`

## What Was Wrong?

Old PR had `System.Drawing.Common` version mismatch:
- Translation project: 8.0.0 ✅
- Main project: 7.0.0 ❌

## What's Fixed?

Both now use 8.0.0 ✅

## What's Next?

Create release → Workflow builds everything → Download from [Releases](https://github.com/mimomi666/Translumo/releases)
