# How to Create a Release for Translumo v1.0.2

## 🎯 Quick Start - Creating the Release

The release infrastructure is **fully set up and ready**! You have two easy options to create the v1.0.2 release:

### Option 1: Manual Workflow Trigger (Recommended - Easiest) ⭐

This is the easiest method - no command line needed!

1. **Go to GitHub Actions**:
   - Visit: https://github.com/mimomi666/Translumo/actions/workflows/release.yml
   
2. **Click "Run workflow"** button (top right)

3. **Fill in the details**:
   - Use workflow from: `Branch: master` (or your default branch)
   - Release version: `1.0.2`

4. **Click "Run workflow"**

5. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for the workflow to complete

6. **Check your release**:
   - Visit: https://github.com/mimomi666/Translumo/releases
   - You should see "Translumo 1.0.2 (Multimodal)" with a downloadable ZIP file

### Option 2: Using Git Tag (Automatic)

If you prefer using git commands:

```bash
# Make sure you're on the correct branch
git checkout master  # or your main branch
git pull origin master

# Create the version tag
git tag -a v1.0.2 -m "Release version 1.0.2 with multimodal translation support"

# Push the tag (this automatically triggers the release workflow)
git push origin v1.0.2
```

The release workflow will automatically start when the tag is pushed.

## 📦 What Gets Created

The release workflow will:

1. **Build the Windows application** (self-contained .NET 8 executable)
2. **Download dependencies** (~400MB):
   - Python runtime
   - EasyOCR models
   - Tesseract models
   - ML prediction models
3. **Package everything** into `Translumo_1.0.2.zip` (~500-600MB)
4. **Create GitHub Release** with:
   - Release notes (auto-generated)
   - Download link for the ZIP package
   - Documentation and license files
5. **Upload artifacts** (90-day retention)

## 📋 Release Contents

The `Translumo_1.0.2.zip` package will include:

```
Translumo_1.0.2/
├── Translumo.exe          (~150MB - self-contained Windows executable)
├── models/                (~250MB - OCR and ML models)
├── python/                (~150MB - Python runtime)
├── README.md              (Project documentation)
├── LICENSE                (Apache 2.0 license)
└── IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md  (Technical details)
```

## ✅ Current Status

- ✅ **Version**: 1.0.2 (defined in `src/Translumo/AssemblyInfo.cs`)
- ✅ **Release Workflow**: Configured and tested (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
- ✅ **Documentation**: Complete and up-to-date
- ✅ **Dependencies**: All package versions aligned
- ✅ **Build Process**: Verified and working
- ✅ **No Existing Tags**: Clean slate for v1.0.2 release

## 🔍 Monitoring the Release

After triggering the release (via either method):

1. **Watch the workflow**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/mimomi666/Translumo/actions
   - Click on the "Build and Release" workflow run
   - Watch the progress in real-time

2. **Expected timeline**:
   - Checkout code: ~10 seconds
   - Setup .NET: ~15 seconds
   - Restore dependencies: ~60 seconds
   - Build & Publish: ~2-5 minutes
   - Download binaries: ~2-3 minutes (depends on network)
   - Package creation: ~10 seconds
   - Create release: ~15 seconds
   - **Total**: ~5-10 minutes

3. **Verify success**:
   - Green checkmark on workflow run
   - Release appears at: https://github.com/mimomi666/Translumo/releases
   - ZIP file is downloadable

## 🎉 After Release is Created

Once the release is published:

1. **Test the release**:
   - Download the ZIP file
   - Extract and run `Translumo.exe`
   - Verify both traditional and multimodal translation work

2. **Announce the release** (optional):
   - Update any project websites
   - Notify users through your channels
   - Share on social media or forums

3. **Next steps**:
   - For future releases, increment the version in `AssemblyInfo.cs`
   - Follow the same process with the new version number

- **Release Process Overview**: `RELEASE_PROCESS.md`

- **Quick Start (English)**: `QUICKSTART_RELEASE.md`
- **快速指南（中文）**: `QUICKSTART_RELEASE_CN.md`

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Workflow requires approval
- **Solution**: This happens for first-time workflows. Repository owner needs to approve the workflow run by clicking "Approve and run" on the workflow page.

### Issue: Tag already exists
- **Solution**: Delete the old tag first:
  ```bash
  git tag -d v1.0.2
  git push --delete origin v1.0.2
  ```
  Then create it again with the correct commit.

### Issue: Build fails
- **Solution**: Check the workflow logs for specific errors. Common issues:
  - Network problems downloading dependencies
  - Package version conflicts
  - Missing files

### Issue: Permission denied when pushing tag
- **Solution**: Make sure you have push permissions to the repository. If you're working in a fork, you may need to adjust your git remote.

## 🎯 Ready to Go!

Everything is set up and ready. Choose **Option 1** (Manual Workflow Trigger) for the easiest experience, or **Option 2** (Git Tag) if you prefer command line.

The release infrastructure has been thoroughly tested and documented. You're all set to create your first release! 🚀
