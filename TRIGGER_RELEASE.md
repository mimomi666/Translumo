## 🎯 Three Ways to Trigger the Release

### Method 1: Use GitHub Actions UI (EASIEST - Recommended) ⭐

This is the simplest method that doesn't require command line:

1. **Visit the Actions page:**
   ```
   https://github.com/mimomi666/Translumo/actions/workflows/release.yml
   ```

2. **Click the green "Run workflow" button** (top right)

3. **Fill in the form:**
   - Use workflow from: `Branch: main` (or `master`)
   - Release version: `1.0.2`

4. **Click "Run workflow"**

5. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for the build to complete

6. **Check your release:**
   ```
   https://github.com/mimomi666/Translumo/releases
   ```

### Method 2: Use the Automated Script

If you prefer command line:

**On Windows:**
```cmd
create_release.bat
```

**On Linux/Mac:**
```bash
./create_release.sh
```

### Method 3: Manual Git Commands

```bash
git checkout main  # or master
git pull origin main
git tag -a v1.0.2 -m "Release version 1.0.2 with multimodal translation support"
git push origin v1.0.2
```
